### Overview of the Project

This course, "Leveraging Data in Iterative Product Design," is part of the three-part Udacity Data Product Nanodegree. It specifically focuses on extracting insights from live user data generated on the Flyber app to enhance product design and drive user engagement. The project comprises different sections, including:  

- Funnel Analysis: Conducting funnel analysis on the different stages of the user journey to complete the task of booking a flight.  
- A/B Testing: Performing multiple A/B tests to compare each experimental variant of the app UI against the existing UI (Control) and recommending next steps, if any.  
- Segment-Based Analysis: Conducting a segment-based funnel analysis based on age and geography to understand if any of the segments are driving the A/B test results.  
- User Surveys: Utilizing survey results from users to glean possible explanations for the A/B test results.  
- Hypotheses Construction: Constructing hypotheses for new product features of the Flyber app based on experimental results and interview data.  
- Multivariate Experiment Design: Designing a multivariate experiment to carry out these hypotheses.  

This project provides a comprehensive understanding of how data can be leveraged to optimize product design and enhance user engagement.
